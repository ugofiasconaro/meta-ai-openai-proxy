# Data Directory

This directory is intended to store data files required by the application.

## `session_data.json`

The `session_data.json` file is crucial for the application's functionality. It is **not** included in the repository and must be generated by the user.

To create `session_data.json`, please run the `grab_cookies.py` script located in the project's root directory:

```bash
python grab_cookies.py
```

This script will guide you through the process of generating the necessary session data.
